*DESCRIPTON*:
This project is a simple, responsive portfolio website designed using just HTML and CSS. It is meant to help a web developer showcase their personal information, completed projects, and contact details in a clean and professional layout. The website is a single-page design, meaning all the content is contained within one page and is accessible through a navigation bar that smoothly scrolls to each section. The site layout adjusts nicely on different screen sizes, making it usable on both desktop and mobile devices without any extra setup.

The structure of the website includes three main sections: About, Projects, and Contact. At the top of the page, there is a fixed header with a navigation bar. This header contains the site’s logo or name on the left and navigation links on the right. These links allow users to jump to different sections of the page instantly. The About section introduces the developer with a short bio. It describes the developer’s skills and interests, giving visitors a quick overview of who they are and what they do.

The Projects section presents a grid layout with three example projects. Each project is displayed as a card with a title and a brief description. The grid automatically adjusts based on screen size to keep the layout clean and readable, even on smaller screens. These cards are styled to appear elevated with subtle shadowing, and they animate slightly when hovered over, giving the page a more interactive and polished feel.

The Contact section provides basic contact information, including an email address, which is clickable. This allows visitors to contact the developer easily without needing a complex form or backend integration. At the bottom of the page, a footer gives credit and includes copyright information.

Styling is done entirely with CSS and includes custom fonts, color gradients, shadows, and spacing to create a modern, visually pleasing design. The layout uses Flexbox and CSS Grid, which help make the website responsive and structured. For smaller screens, the navigation menu automatically stacks into a vertical layout to ensure readability and accessibility.

This project is ideal for students, beginner developers, or anyone looking to build and publish a simple online presence without using JavaScript frameworks or backend services. It can be run directly in any browser and is especially easy to test using a code editor like Visual Studio Code. With the Live Server extension in VS Code, the site can be previewed in real time during development.

The simplicity of the setup also makes it easy to customize. Developers can update text, add new projects, link to GitHub or LinkedIn, or even include a downloadable resume. Since no JavaScript is involved, the website loads quickly and can be hosted easily using free platforms like GitHub Pages or Netlify. Overall, this portfolio site serves as a strong starting point for building an online portfolio using only basic web development tools.
